# portofolio-react

A simple personal portfolio built with **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**.

This repo was originally created as an assignment for my **Portfolio Development course**, but I’m planning to keep updating it over time as I add more projects.

Live demo: https://krisnaarji.github.io/portofolio-react/

## ✨ Overview

Right now the app is intentionally very simple:

- Everything is rendered in a single file: `App.tsx`
- All project data is **static / hard-coded**
- The main goal was to **get it working quickly** so it could be used for the course 😄

Planned improvements:

- Split the page into smaller, reusable components (sections for About, Projects, etc.)
- Move project data into a separate data structure (e.g. JSON/TS array)
- Add more projects as I complete new assignments and personal work
